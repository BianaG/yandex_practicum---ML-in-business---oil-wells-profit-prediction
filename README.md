# yandex_practicum---ML-in-business---oil-wells-profit-prediction
In this project, the main objective is to find the best place out of three regions to develop new 200 oil wells. We will build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in new wells, pick the wells with the highest estimated reserves, and then choose the region with the highest estimated total profit for the selected oil wells.

The libraries and modules that were being used in this project are as follows:
1. pandas
2. sidetable
3. math
4. numpy
5. numpy.random
6. statistics
7. matplotlib.pyplot
8. seaborn
9. sklearn.linear_model
10. sklearn.metrics
11. sklearn.model_selection
12. sklearn.preprocessing
